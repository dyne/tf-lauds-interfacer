### What is **INTERFACER?**

The goal of the INTERFACER project is to build the open-source digital infrastructure for Fab Cities.

Our vision is to promote a green, resilient, and digitally-based mode of production and consumption that enables the greatest possible sovereignty, empowerment and participation of citizens all over the world.
We want to help Fab Cities to produce everything they consume by 2054 on the basis of collaboratively developed and globally shared data in the commons.

## 🎮 Quick start

For the deployment you need the `sshkey` file, with an authorized private key, and
`.vault_pass`, which let's you open vars and hosts files.

Then you can start the deployment with
```bash
make install
```

Ansible's vault file can be opened with
```bash
make open FILE={{ path }}
```
